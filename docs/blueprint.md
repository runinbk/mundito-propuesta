## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #ED1C24 (RGB) - A vibrant red representing Munditoys' brand identity, to be used sparingly for key interactive elements.
- Background color: #222222 (RGB) for dark mode. Heavily desaturated deep-black hue; a near-black will create a dramatic but not tiring contrast with lighter elements. In light mode: #FFFFFF (RGB)
- Accent color: #FFAE00 (RGB) - An analogous, vibrant orange will make calls to action stand out against the red and deep-black background without clashing. For light mode: #00AEEF (RGB).
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' offers a techy, up-to-date feel that matches the company's design priorities; for blocks of text longer than a short paragraph, Inter will promote comfortable reading.
- Utilize a responsive grid system for consistent layout across all devices, ensuring a fluid adaptation to different screen sizes.
- Employ native CSS transitions and animations for UI elements to provide smooth and efficient visual feedback.
- Use minimalist, custom icons for navigation and key features, designed in a style that complements the selected color palette and typography.
